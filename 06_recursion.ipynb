    "# Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. In recursive functions, the function definition includes a reference to the function itself, allowing it to be called within its own body.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of recursion involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Base Case: The recursive function checks for a base case, which represents the simplest form of the problem that can be directly solved without further recursion. When the base case is reached, the recursion stops, and the function returns a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Recursive Case: If the base case is not satisfied, the function makes one or more recursive calls to itself, but with a smaller input or a subproblem that is closer to the base case. Each recursive call solves a smaller part of the problem and contributes to the overall solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Recursive Progression: The recursive calls continue until the base case is reached. During each recursive call, the function breaks down the original problem into smaller subproblems, making progress towards the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive functions often involve the concept of \"divide and conquer,\" where a complex problem is divided into simpler subproblems that are solved independently. The results of these subproblems are then combined to obtain the final solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of a recursive function in Python to calculate the factorial of a number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def factorial(n):\n",
    "    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1\n",
    "    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    # Recursive case: factorial of n is n multiplied by factorial of (n-1)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this factorial function, the base case is when `n` is 0 or 1, where the function directly returns 1. In the recursive case, the function calls itself with `n-1` and multiplies the current value of `n` with the factorial of `(n-1)`. This process continues until the base case is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion can be a powerful technique for solving problems that can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems. However, it's important to ensure that the recursive function converges towards the base case and does not result in infinite recursion. Proper termination conditions and careful design are essential for correct recursive implementations."

    "## Call stack\n",
    "\n",
    "The call stack is an important concept to understand when working with recursive functions or any function calls in general. It is a data structure used by the program to keep track of function calls, their local variables, and return addresses. Each time a function is called, a new frame is created on the call stack to store the function's execution context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The call stack allows recursive functions to keep track of multiple function calls by creating new frames for each function call and storing the necessary information. It is essential to understand the call stack when working with recursive functions to visualize the flow of execution and ensure proper handling of recursive calls and termination conditions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Merge sort is a popular sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by dividing the unsorted list into smaller sublists, recursively sorting them, and then merging the sorted sublists to obtain the final sorted list. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how merge sort works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Divide: The unsorted list is divided into two halves, roughly equal in size. This division is performed recursively until each sublist contains only one element (which is already considered sorted).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Conquer: After dividing the list, the recursion backtracks and merges the sorted sublists. The merging process starts with pairs of adjacent sublists and combines them into larger sorted sublists. This process continues until a single sorted list is obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Merge: To merge the sublists, a merging algorithm is employed. It compares the elements from each sublist and places them in the correct order in a temporary array. The temporary array is then copied back into the original list, resulting in a sorted merged sublist.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The process continues recursively until all sublists are merged and a fully sorted list is obtained."

    "The function recursively divides the list into two halves until each sublist contains only one element. Then, the `merge` function is used to merge the sorted sublists back together. The merging process compares the elements from the left and right sublists, placing them in the correct order in a temporary array. Finally, the sorted merged sublist is returned. Merge sort offers an efficient and stable sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average and worst cases."
